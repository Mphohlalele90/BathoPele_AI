# BathoPele_AI: Ethical Patient Intake & Resource Monitoring

## Project Overview

BathoPele_AI is a Python-based application built with Streamlit to address administrative challenges in South Africa's public hospitals. The app automates patient intake, verifies identity documents, and provides real-time resource monitoringâ€”supporting SDG 3 (Good Health and Well-being) and SDG 10 (Reduced Inequalities).
